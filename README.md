##  Introduction

Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) plays a crucial role in industrial manufacturing. However, existing FSAD methods encounter difficulties leveraging a limited number of normal samples, frequently failing to detect and locate inconspicuous anomalies in the spatial domain. We have further discovered that these subtle anomalies would be more noticeable in the frequency domain. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Path Frequency Discriminators (DFD) network from a frequency perspective to tackle these issues.  The original spatial images are transformed into multi-frequency images, making them more conducive to the tailored discriminators in detecting anomalies. Additionally, the discriminators learn a joint representation with forms of pseudo-anomalies.
